# Option-Pricing
Contains code regarding option pricing. Some of this code is in conjunction with a maths project I'm doing on the Black-Scholes model.

V1: Simple option valuator taht takes in 5 user inputs to value the option usng the Black-Scholes model.

V2: Added range and type checks into the program. Still fundamentally runs the same way as V1.

V3: Added a monte carlo simulation that calculates the option's price using the same modelling assumptions. This can be used for accuracy comparison with out Black-Scholes calculated value.
